PSA services can be instantiated in two different ways:

1- Via the <<_psa_portal,ProActive Service Automation>> (PSA) Portal.

2- Via standard workflows (also called *Management Workflows*). ProActive includes predefined standard workflows that manage PSA service lifecycles (e.g., launch and stop PSA services).
These workflows are provided in the bucket *Service_Automation* under the project *Service Automation - Management*. Their names are constructed using the pattern *PSA_Service_Name* followed by the suffix *_Service*.
